# Quote-Me-Walter-White

## Project Description

Our project is a website that allows users to generate quotes from the series Breaking Bad. This allows enthusiasts to use these quotes on their social media platforms or share them with friends. The main challenge we faced came from finding a suitable API that we could utilise to perform the desired function. An additional challenge was finding another API that worked efficiently with our initial API.
We were able to overcome this through searching different API’s and their functions. Once we found API’s that worked closely with our plan, we were able to adapt them and make minor changes so that the website worked efficiently.

The second API was a search engine for TV series' that allows users to input the title of the series, and the webpage would return the relevant series, image and plot. 
 
Moreover, since this was our first collaborative project we faced challenges navigating the command line to ensure each member was working on the latest version of the files.
We sought help from our instructors, and we are still trying to develop our understanding on this.
